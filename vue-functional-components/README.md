# Vue => Component

```html
<λ>Hello World!</λ>
```

## Functional Components

Functional components are stateless, instance-less components that are purely a
function of their props.

### Stateless

* A _"stateless"_ component does not have a `data` property/method
* Renders using only `props`

### Instance-less

* No component object is instantiated
* _`this`_ is not bound to a component

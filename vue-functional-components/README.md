# Vue Functional Components

```html
<λ>Hello World!</λ>
```

## What are they

Functional components are stateless, instance-less components that are purely a
function of their props.

### Stateless

* A _"stateless"_ component does not have a `data` property/method
* Renders from `props` only

### Instance-less

* _`this`_ does not refer to the Vue component prototype
